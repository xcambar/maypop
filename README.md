__Maypop__ is a simple implementation of Apect Oriented Programming (AOP) for any ECMAScript5 engine.
Hence it works on Node.js and modern browsers.

# Aspect oriented programming

Aspect oriented programming allows developers to add behaviour (_aspects_) to functions and
objects by declaring functions that should be run _before_, _after_ and _around_ other methods.

# Example

    //Need to find better than "just an example"
    //meanwhile, you should read the tests to have a clear view of what's possible
